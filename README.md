Bootstrap Thumbnail Gallery
===========================

Simple gallery that displays a large image and thumbnails below. This is mainly useful for project pages that may have images ranging from nothing to large amounts.

This is meant to show small thumbnails below the large image. If you click on the small image it will rotate to the corresponding large image.

The large image can be setup to be clicked on and popup in the modal window. Only works on image 1 currently.
